    <p>Fishball has been two years old in August this year.
    He is a Garfield, and his character is timid and full of curiosity.
    Relieved and very intelligent.</p>

    <p>What surprised me the most was that I didn't teach him to open the door,
    but he imitated my movements by observing,
    then opened all the cabinets in the house,
    and fed them into the mouth with his hands.</p>
